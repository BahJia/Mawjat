At the heart of Mawjat lies the decentralized music streaming mechanism. Music tracks uploaded by artists are stored securely and made available for listeners worldwide. The integration with blockchain ensures that every stream and purchase is transparently recorded. Additionally, the platform supports NFT-Based Music Sales, allowing artists to mint and sell their music as unique digital assets and co-own them with listeners to share revenue.
## Features  


- **Blockchain:** Leveraging NEAR Protocol (or whichever blockchain you're using) for transparent and secure transactions.
- **Decentralized Music Streaming:** Offering a platform where artists' music is directly accessible to fans without intermediaries.
- **Live Feature:** utilizing dynamic NFTs for a changeable content creation including: live concert, live jam session, and Podcast.
- **NFT-Based Music:** Enabling artists to mint their music as NFTs.
- **Co-Ownership & Revenue Sharing:** Ensuring fair revenue distribution among artists and stakeholders through frictionalized NFTs.
- **Music Labs:** Promoting collaboration, networking, and skill enhancement while offering educational onboarding to web3.
